## How to Use This Repository

Each folder in this repository contains a coding exercise designed to test your understanding of **basic Solidity syntax**.  

- **Task:** Solve the problem in each folder.  
- **Reference:** The `answers.txt` file contains the expected solution (my implementation).  
- **Goal:** Your code must function **like the code in `answers.txt`**, but you should write it yourself.  

> Tip: Focus on understanding the logic and syntax rather than copying the solution.
