Create a contract that:

1. Lets a user **add numbers** into an array.
2. Provides a function to **calculate the sum** of all numbers in the array.
3. Provides a function to **find the largest number** in the array.
4. Provides a function to **clear the entire array**.
5. Provides a function to **view all numbers** in the array.
6. Ensure that functions that read the array without modifying it are properly marked with `view`.
7. Use `require` statements to handle empty arrays where necessary.
